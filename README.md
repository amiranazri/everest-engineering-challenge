        - **Offer.js**: Defines an offer's properties and methods for validation and discount calculation.
        - **Package.js**: Represents a delivery package.
        - **Vehicle.js**: Represents a delivery vehicle.
    - **repositories**: Handles data management.
        
        - **OfferRepository.js**: Loads and manages offers from the JSON configuration.
    - **services**: Contains business logic.
        
        - **DeliveryCostEstimator.js**: Calculates the delivery cost considering potential discounts.
        - **DeliveryScheduler.js**: Manages the scheduling of package deliveries based on vehicle availability and package weight.

    - **tests**: Contains test cases.
        
        - **DeliveryCostEstimator.test.js**: Tests for the cost estimation logic.
        - **DeliveryScheduler.test.js**: Tests for the scheduling logic.

3. **index.js**: Entry point for the application, handling user input and coordinating between different module

## Explanation for Project Structure
- **Modularity**: Each part of the project (like models and services) is kept in its own section. This makes the code easier to manage and grow.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Different tasks are handled in different places (like data handling, business logic, and utilities), making the project easier to understand and work on.
- **Configuration Management**: Offer codes are stored in a separate file (config/offers.json). This makes it easy to update them without changing the main code.
- **Testing**: The tests folder contains tests to make sure everything works correctly, helping maintain the quality and reliability of the code.
- **Entry Point**: The index.js file is where the program starts. It manages user input and connects all parts of the project.

This setup helps create a flexible and scalable application for estimating delivery costs and scheduling deliveries, making it easy to develop and maintain each part of the system separately.
